Topic classification is a ‘supervised’ machine learning technique, one that needs training before being able to automatically analyze texts.
A topic classification model could also be used to determine what customers are talking about in customer reviews, open-ended survey responses, and on social media, to name just a few.
This classify text paragraphs into specific topics based on the content and any mentioned entities such as persons, organizations, or products.
The model should consider not just the textual content but also whether the paragraph mentions specific entities, enhancing its prediction accuracy.
