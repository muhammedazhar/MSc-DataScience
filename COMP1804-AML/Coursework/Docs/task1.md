1. SMOTE and Randon Under-Sampling
2. NLTK and WordEmbeddings
3. Advanced NLP and ANN
4. Named Entity Recognition (NER)

I need a higher accuracy rate not less than 90%. So, I would like to accommodate the following improvements:
- Utilise NLTK and WordEmbeddings (Word2Vec)
- While the balancing techniques have been applied, ensuring the model is not biased toward the majority class is crucial, which can be monitored by looking at the recall and F1-score metrics.
- Depending on the nature and complexity of the dataset, more complex models such as SVM, Random Forest, or deep learning models like CNNs or LSTMs might perform better.
- Implementing cross-validation would help to ensure that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the dataset.
