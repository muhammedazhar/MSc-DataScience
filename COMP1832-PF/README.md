# `COMP1832` Programming Fundamentals for Data Science

**Institution:** University of Greenwich  
**Faculty:** Faculty of Engineering and Science  
**School:** School of Computing & Mathematical Sciences  
**Credits:** 15  
**Module Delivery:** Term 1  
**Module Leader:** Dr. Jia Wang  
**Module Instructor:** Dr. Konstantin Kapinchev  

## Overview

The *Programming Fundamentals for Data Science* (COMP1832) module is designed to equip students with the foundational skills in data analytics and visualization using two leading programming languages: Python and R. These skills are essential in addressing key challenges in data science and developing practical solutions that involve data manipulation, processing, and interpretation.

Through this module, students will gain hands-on experience with various data structures and processing techniques commonly used by data analysts and data scientists. Additionally, the course covers statistical methods for data processing, enabling students to transform raw data into meaningful insights.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, students will be able to:

1. Demonstrate a critical understanding of commonly used data structures and processing techniques for data science projects.
2. Acquire in-depth knowledge of data processing pipelines and apply this knowledge to develop data science solutions.
3. Design, build, and critically assess data manipulation techniques for practical applications.

## Module Content

### Key Topics

- **Programming in Python**: Introduction to Python, data types, and data structures, with a focus on data science applications.
- **Advanced Data Processing**: Implementing and optimizing data processing pipelines using Python and R.
- **Statistics with Python and R**: Applying statistical methods to analyze data.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating meaningful visualizations to interpret complex datasets.
- **Programming in R**: Introduction to the R programming language, focusing on data manipulation and analysis.

Students will also engage with real-world data analysis problems, applying the full data analysis lifecycleâ€”from handling raw data to producing comprehensive analytic reports.

## Assessment

This module is assessed through a **100% coursework-based portfolio**. The portfolio consists of two tasks:

- One task implemented using Python.
- One task implemented using R.

The portfolio will include various problems to solve, focusing on data transformation, visualization, and analysis. Each task must be well-documented, and solutions should demonstrate a clear understanding of data science principles.

**Submission Deadline:**  
Portfolio submission: 29th November 2024
