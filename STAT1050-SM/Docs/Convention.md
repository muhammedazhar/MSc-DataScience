# Coding Convention

## R Naming Convention

The recommended file extension for **R scripts** is `.R` with an uppercase “R” because it follows the widely accepted convention within the R community, ensuring consistency and readability across platforms and development environments. While both `.r` (lowercase) and `.R` will technically work, using `.R` aligns with standard practices, making your scripts easily recognizable in projects that may also include other file types, such as Python (`.py`) or JavaScript (`.js`). Additionally, some tools and editors like **RStudio** and **VS Code** are optimized to recognize `.R` scripts, which can enhance compatibility and ease of use. Adopting `.R` ensures that your scripts adhere to the convention that most R developers follow, promoting consistency, especially in collaborative projects.
