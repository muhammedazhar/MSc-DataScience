# Coursework
You are to carry out a visual data exploration for ChrisCo, the fictional company whose sales and website data we have been analysing throughout the module. 

The ChrisCo company is fictional but nonetheless very successful. It manages a chain of cinemas across the UK. ChrisCo collects a vast amount of data about individual customers visiting its cinemas using its loyalty card scheme, and this customer data has been aggregated/averaged over a four-year period to give information about the companyâ€™s cinemas, each identified by a unique 3-letter code (e.g., ABC, XYZ, etc.). 

You should compile the data into two data frames: one containing customer data (one row for each date) and the other containing summary data (one row for each cinema), compiled from all of the .csv files, including the visitor data.

Your task is to investigate the data visually and present some conclusions about any characteristics you discover, including correlations, seasonal behaviour, outliers, etc., together with a suggestion about how the data might be best segmented based on the total volume of visits at each cinema.

The company is most interested in the high and medium volume cinemas but would like a summary of the low volume cinemas plus any anomalies you identify in the data. You should also identify new cinemas that have been opened over the period or cinemas that the company has closed over the period.

You should present your findings in the form of data visualisations for the company, i.e. based on the assumption that the reader knows nothing about data visualisation.

The code should make use of some of the examples taught in the lectures. You may use additional code examples from elsewhere but only to supplement the lecture examples, not to replace them entirely. At least 2 of the visualisations in the notebook should be interactive and provide functionality to explore the data in more detail.
