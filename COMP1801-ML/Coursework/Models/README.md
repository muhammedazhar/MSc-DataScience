# Solution Models for the Coursework

This directory contains the solution models for the coursework. The models are used to predict the `Lifespan` of the metal parts `partType` for the regression task and the classification model will predict the `Lifetime` class of a metal parts in the given dataset located in the [`../Datasets`](../Datasets/) directory.
