### Task C.1: Data Lake Implementation

**Objective:** Explain the rationale behind choosing a Data Lake over a Data Warehouse for ABC Investment Bank's needs, considering the vast and varied data sources and the necessity for flexible, scalable data storage and analysis capabilities.

- **Definition and Benefits of Data Lake:**
  - A Data Lake is a centralized repository that allows for the storage of structured and unstructured data at any scale. The flexibility and scalability of Data Lakes make them ideal for handling the Big Data needs of ABC Investment Bank.
- **Implementation Approach:**
  - Discuss the step-by-step approach for implementing Data Lakes, referencing Lecture 9 for technical details and component requirements.

### Task C.2: Real-Time Performance Analysis

**Objective:** Assess whether MapReduce is the optimal solution for processing the Bank's requirement for near real-time performance in analyzing financial products discussed on social media.

- **Real-Time Performance Needs:**
  - Given the Bank's need for timely action based on social media discussions, evaluate the suitability of MapReduce for real-time data processing.
- **Alternative Approaches:**
  - Propose alternative solutions that may offer improved real-time processing capabilities, with technical justifications.

### Task C.3: Hosting Strategy Development

**Objective:** Devise a detailed hosting strategy that aligns with the project's scalability, high availability, and confidentiality requirements, particularly for the trading decisions produced.

- **Hosting Options:**
  - Compare Public, Private, and Hybrid Cloud strategies in the context of the Bank's global operational requirements and the need for confidentiality.
- **Recommended Strategy:**
  - Justify the chosen hosting strategy based on scalability, high availability, and security considerations, referencing Lecture 10 for cloud computing insights.
